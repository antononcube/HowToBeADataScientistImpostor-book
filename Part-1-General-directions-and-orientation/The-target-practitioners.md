# The target practitioners

This book targets the following five archetypes of Data Science practitioners.

## Simple Nuclear Physicist (SNP)

SNP is someone who is accustomed to obtaining a lot of data that has to be analyzed and mined sometimes 
very deeply, rigorously, and from a lot of angles, in order to confirm or reject different 
hypotheses or conjectures.
 
SNP is fairly adept in programming and critical thinking, 
but he does not have or care about deep knowledge of statistical methods or Machine Learning algorithms.
 
SNP is willing and capable to use software libraries that provide algorithms for doing Statistics and Machine Learning.

## Common Operations Research Analyst (CORA)

CORA is someone shared by different departments in some large company like 
Big Amusement Parks Corporation or Large Vacation Cruises Company. 
CORA is an internal consultant providing different kinds of decision support for different types of stakeholders. 

In the Large Vacation Cruises Company CORA is responsible for ships routes design and rerouting, 
price elasticity models for vacation packages, products and services placement within a ship.

CORA has moderate to very good programming skills.

CORA work is used (or should be used) to make core business decisions. (And fringe ones too.)   

## Standard Machine Learning Engineer (SMLE)

This guy is a typical Machine Learning practitioner. 
SMLE uses Machine Learning tools on a regular basis, but does not necessarily use the corresponding mindset.
SMLE might be called "Data Scientist" or "Data Engineer" by some.

Some of the projects SMLE has worked on might be recommendations of digital content, 
anomaly detection in time series, or text summarization. 

SMLE is (and expected to be) a very good programmer regularly utilizing a few programming languages.

SMLE tends to smile and feel most satisfied when making -- and finishing -- software products.

## Pretending Typical Statistician in Demand (PTSD)

This guy is a statistician branding himself as a Data Scientist 
(because of money and/or prestige and/or institutional pressure.)
 
PTSD thinks classical statistical methods are most relevant to the problems given to PTSD and 
PTSD is inclined to do data modeling first and then apply the usual statistical methods. 

PTSD is not (expected to be) as good of a programmer as the archetypes listed above.

PTSD might be really annoyed that the so called Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers 
usurped PTSD's domain of professional interest. (And PTSD is learning to live with that.)

(Let us point out, though, that if we are dealing with data then *we are* doing Statistics.)

## Technically Knowledgeable Opportunist (TKO) 

This guy is an entrepreneur, manager, hacker, investor, or a technical writer or blogger. 

TKO wants to utilize Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), or Data Science (DS) 
in order to satisfy personal curiosity, get rich, help friends and coworkers, or climb corporate ladders.

TKO has the ability to follow any engineering and mathematical conversation analogous to 
the ability of an average six year old French child to follow dialogs between two average French adults. 

TKO is also somewhat of a mad scientist, and as any mad scientist TKO is short on hunchbacks. 
That is why TKO tries to employ and utilize ML, AI, DS, etc.

TKO can program, or use interactive interface tools that provide Data Science and Machine Learning functionalities.
(Like SPSS, Alterix, DataIKU, etc.)
